**Vilia** is a cross-media project in development that aims to combine a **tactical turn-based game** and an **audio fiction series** within a shared narrative universe. Both media formats will be built upon consistent worldbuilding and lore, with each leveraging its unique strengths to enhance the audience experience.

- [Tactics](Tactics/index)
- [Stories](Stories/index)

This wiki serves as the central repository for all creative documentation providing organization for the project's development across both formats.

[Guillaume Kuc](https://guillaumekuc.github.io/links) is currently the sole contributor to this developing cross-media concept.
