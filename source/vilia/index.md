**Vilia** is a cross-media project in development that aims to combine a **tactical turn-based game** and an **audio fiction series** within a shared narrative universe. Both media formats will be built upon consistent worldbuilding and lore, with each leveraging its unique strengths to enhance the audience experience.

The tactical game, planned for development in Unreal Engine, intends to create immersion through engaging gameplay and interactivity, as well as an appealing visual style.

The audio fiction will focus on storytelling, character development, and sound design. Each episode is planned to include original music and cover art.

This wiki serves as the central repository for all creative documentation providing organization for the project's development across both formats.

[Guillaume Kuc](https://guillaumekuc.github.io/links) is currently the sole contributor to this developing cross-media concept.
